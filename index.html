      <h2>Dance Concept Summary</h2>
      <p>
        My piece “At a Crossroads” explores transitional stages in life where you must decide 
        what path to take next. It is inspired by the novel The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, specifically the 
        scene where the main character compares her life and its future possibilities to the branches 
        and fruit on a fig tree, and imagines starving to death in the crotch of the tree while the figs fall 
        and rot at her feet due to her inability to choose just one. I want to explore the paralyzing 
        indecision and anxiety that can surround planning your future path, dealing with conflicting 
        aspirations, and the fear of making the wrong choice. I want to communicate to the audience 
        that we all have moments in life where we are unsure of the direction we are headed and are 
        paralyzed by indecision, but it is important to take a leap onto a path even if it is scary and see 
        where it leads you, rather than letting the fear of the unknown consume you. The work follows 
        an individual in a dreamlike state who is surrounded by manifestations of her potential futures, 
        and she is pulled in different directions as she tries to decide on a path. Each of the other 
        dancers represents a different future path for the individual. The first section of the work will 
        be set to Gardermoen by Julia Kent and the movement will be curious and investigative as the 
        individual explores the different pathways that she might take. The second section of the work 
        will be set to Tempelhof by Julia Kent, and the movement will become increasingly frantic and 
        urgent as the individual becomes overwhelmed by all of the possibilities, and fears that 
        choosing one path will lead to losing all of the others. Some movement ideas that I would like 
        to explore are contact and partnering, pulling, opposing forces, and following impulses. I would 
        also like to explore creating structures and images with my dancers such as the bell jar, the fig 
        tree, and winding pathways. </p>

      <h2>Costume Treatment</h2>
      <p><b>Choreographer(s):</b> Gwynevere Deterding</p>
      <p><b>Cast Size:</b> 7 dancers</p>
      <p><b>Music/Sound:</b> Gardermoen and Tempelhof by Julia Kent</p>
      <p><b>Dance Style:</b> Contemporary</p>
      <p><b>Name of Piece:</b> At A Crossroads</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Inspiration:</b></p>
      <p><b>What inspired the creation of your piece?</b></p>
      <p>The creation of my piece was inspired by the novel The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, specifically the fig tree metaphor where the narrator relates her life and its future paths and possibilities to the fruit hanging from the branches of a fig tree and imagines the fruit falling and rotting at her feet due to her inability to choose only one.</p>
      <p><b>How has that original inspiration evolved through your process?</b></p>
      <p>While the original inspiration still stands, it has evolved to become additionally inspired by my own experiences of transitional periods in my life where I’ve had conflicting aspirations and felt paralyzed by tough decisions. I have one dancer who represents the person stuck at a crossroads, and the other dancers reflect potential future paths that that person could choose. </p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Purpose of your work:</b></p>
      <p><b>What is the point or purpose of the work itself?</b></p>
      <p>The purpose of the work is to depict the experience of being stuck at a crossroads in life, and feeling pulled in different directions. Sometimes we feel like we have to give up on one dream we’ve had in order to pursue another, and sometimes we are so paralyzed by tough decisions that it is hard to keep moving forward. </p>
      <p><b>What mood and/or emotions are you aiming to invoke with the performance of your finished work?</b></p>
      <p>I want to invoke a dark and haunting mood, and I want the audience to feel a little bit of the anxiety and fear that comes with making tough decisions.</p>
      <p><b>What message are you trying to communicate to the viewer/audience? What are you hoping they take away from experiencing your work? </b></p>
      <p>I want to communicate to the audience that we all have moments in life where we are unsure of the direction we are headed and are paralyzed by indecision, but it is important to take a leap onto a path even if it is scary and see where it leads you, rather than letting the fear of the unknown consume you.</p>
      <p><b>Describe your piece in 3-5 adjectives:</b></p>
      <p>Tense, Haunting, Urgent, Frantic</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Costume Research:</b></p>
      <p>I want my lead dancer to be dressed in a 1960s style collared dress similar to the one pictured below. I want the rest of the cast in other individual 1960s silhouettes but for their dresses to be gray and for the skirt and the sleeves to be tattered/worn looking to appear like ghostly representations of the lead. I want everyone to have their own silhouette to help show that they are each representing a different pathway.</p>

      <h2>Overall Reflection on Feedback Received from Peers, Instructors, and Faculty Mentors</h2>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">My faculty mentor and my peers during the movement study 2 presentation recommended that I further develop each of the individual characters in my work. I have started doing this by assigning each dancer a future path to represent and giving them phrase work containing abstracted gestures that would be performed by that individual. Fen also recommended that I have individual conversations with each dancer about their character and motivations to help them be able to embody the character I want them to portray, so that is something I want to do in the spring semester. In my feedback from the instructors, they mentioned that some of the relationships between dancers weren’t clear in terms of the narrative I was trying to portray, so that is another thing that I will be working on tweaking. Fen also mentioned considering what the group represents when they are together as a collective and creating structures versus when they are their own individuals. They talked about how the group being together could represent the idea of “choice” as a whole. I was also told to keep returning to the tree and path structures that are present in the beginning of the work, so I have begun including more of those in the work and experimenting with my dancers on the creation of new structures. As I continue to develop this work in the spring, I want to explore partnering some more and make the choices that the lead dancer is making come across clearer. </p>
