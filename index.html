      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
         Gwynevere Deterding, from Blue Springs, MO, is a senior at the University of Alabama majoring in dance and computer science. Gwynevere began her dance training at Tajazz School of Dance and later trained at City in Motion Dance Theater and Blue Springs Ballet. While at the University of Alabama, she has performed in productions of Alabama Repertory Dance Theatre, Dance Alabama!, and Emerging Choreographers’ Showcase, as well as appearing in screendances in the Dance Alabama Film Festival. She was also a member of Yonder Contemporary Dance Company, with whom she performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. She has furthered her dance training at intensives including The Ailey School and The USA IBC Dance School. Recently, she received the Outstanding Junior Award from UA Theatre and Dance. Her choreography has been seen in Dance Alabama!, and her most recent work "At a Crossroads" was presented in the Emerging Choreographers' Showcase and at the North Alabama Dance Festival.
      <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
  I am a choreographer who explores themes of identity and the ways we define ourselves, drawing inspiration from modern and contemporary ballet. Drawing influence from Jiří Kylián and Crystal Pite, my movement language combines contact work, pedestrian gestures, and expansive technical movement, grounded in emotional authenticity and spatial clarity.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
  I am particularly interested in constructing visual images and physical structures that embody narrative and metaphor. My creative process frequently begins with the examination of literary texts, especially those centered on self-discovery and existential questioning, and builds from the themes and imagery I find there. I use these findings, along with my personal experiences, to generate movement and spatial design that contribute to the conceptual framework of the work.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
  My recent piece, <em>At a Crossroads</em>, is inspired by Sylvia Plath’s <em>The Bell Jar</em> and explores the paralyzing indecision and anxiety that can accompany major life choices. Through architectural motifs, spatial structure, and partnering, the work investigates how future possibilities can feel simultaneously abundant and inaccessible.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
  I create dance as a means of exploring how we understand who we are and who we want to become, and how that understanding shapes our relationships with others. Through my work, I hope to invite audiences into a reflective space where they can encounter parts of themselves and see new perspectives in the people around them.

    Dance Concept Summary
  </h2>

  <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: auto;">
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
      My piece <em>“At a Crossroads”</em> explores transitional stages in life where you must decide 
      what path to take next. It is inspired by the novel <em>The Bell Jar</em> by Sylvia Plath, specifically the 
      scene where the main character compares her life and its future possibilities to the branches 
      and fruit on a fig tree, and imagines starving to death in the crotch of the tree while the figs fall 
      and rot at her feet due to her inability to choose just one.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
      The piece explores the paralyzing indecision and anxiety that can surround planning your future path, 
      dealing with conflicting aspirations, and the fear of making the wrong choice. It communicates 
      to the audience that we all have moments in life where we are unsure of the direction we are headed 
      and are paralyzed by indecision, but it is important to take a leap onto a path even if it is scary and 
      see where it leads you, rather than letting the fear of the unknown consume you.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
      The narrative follows an individual in a dreamlike state who is surrounded by manifestations of her potential 
      futures, and she is pulled in different directions as she tries to decide on a path. Each of the other 
      dancers represents a different future path for the individual.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
      The first section of the work is set to <em>Gardermoen</em> by Julia Kent, and the movement is curious 
      and investigative as the dancer explores the different pathways that she might take. The second section 
      is set to <em>Tempelhof</em> by Julia Kent, and the movement becomes increasingly frantic and 
      urgent as the individual becomes overwhelmed by all of the possibilities, and fears that choosing one path 
      will lead to losing all of the others.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
      The movement consists of contact and partnering, pulling, opposing forces, 
      and following impulses, and the dancers weave in and out of structures and images of 
      the fig tree, the bell jar, and winding pathways.
    </p>

    Production Elements

  <!-- Costume Section -->
  <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-size: 1.8em; color: #444;">Costume</h3>
  <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 20px auto;">
    <img src="ECSimage4.jpg" alt="Costume Design" style="width: 80%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
      My costumes turned out a bit different than I had originally thought, but I am satisfied with the final product. One of the reviewers instantly noticed the different cuts/silhouettes of the dresses and commented how this indicated “variation or individuals” which was exactly what I was going for. Kylie’s dress was originally going to be yellow or pink, but those colors weren’t going to come in on time. However, I’m glad that we ended up with a sky blue because it was different enough to make her stand out, but close enough to the grays to indicate a clear relationship between her and the other dancers. The distressing of the dresses I had planned didn’t end up occurring either, but I don’t think that took anything away from the concept and may have been distracting.

  <!-- Lighting Section -->
  <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-size: 1.8em; color: #444; margin-top: 50px;">Lighting</h3>
  <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 20px auto;">
    <img src="ECSimage5.jpg" alt="Lighting Design" style="width: 80%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
      Working with my lighting designers was a great experience. They came to our first meeting having read my treatment and watched my movement studies, and had their own treatment created with lighting ideas and inspiration pictures. I didn’t give them much direction besides that I wanted it “dark and moody,” that the first movement should be brighter than the second, and a few specific moments where I knew I wanted silhouettes, but besides that I mostly let them be creative. I really wasn’t expecting the “cotton candy” pink and blue look at all, but it did end up providing the dreamy quality that I was going for. I do wish that I had played a more active role in the lighting, as since this dance was so spatially focused I think I could have been more creative with how the lighting helped to shape the space, but I am also glad that I was able to trust the creative vision of my lighting designers and I’m happy with the result.

      <p style="font-style: italic; margin: 0;">"I couldn’t help but think about the concept of the 'feathers' falling from the tree—each one representing a different direction, a different outcome, a different choice in life. It made me wonder: Are the dancers meant to represent these different possibilities? Is each one navigating a path, and do their movements reflect the different journeys one could take?"</p>

      <p style="font-style: italic; margin: 0;">"There’s something wonderfully organic about the way the piece plays with space, particularly the tree imagery and how the dancers interact with it. It feels as though the space itself is an active participant in the storytelling, almost like the dancers are extensions of the environment, and that connection gives the work a grounded, natural flow."</p>

      <p style="font-style: italic; margin: 0;">"I am appreciating the ways in which this choreographer is employing canon and unison in ways that are not always predictable. They are also inventive with the ways in which solos and duets emerge and dissolve as other things are happening. There is a complexity to the layering that is reflective of the sound and engages me as a viewer."</p>
